# Machine Learning Competition- UBS Pitch 2018 
UBS is always looking for more innovative ways to connect with and provide value to our clients and prospects. In pursuit of this goal, we are looking to apply Machine Learning in how we identify new locations for branch offices. For this competition, you are tasked with using Machine Learning to identify the next 3 locations where UBS should open a Wealth Management branch. As part of this, you are required to come up with a solution that is completely automated and can be repeated upon request. In this project, we helped Union Bank of Switzerland to select the most likely places in the USA to be opened with UBS wealth management branches, see [demo](https://github.com/cy235/UBS_Pitch_2018/blob/master/InsightDataScience_demo_PCA_Final.ipynb).

Here are some examples of open data sources you can use in your algorithms. However, you are not limited to these alone.
1.       http://data.gov
2.       http://www.census.gov/data.html
3.       https://www.healthdata.gov/
During final presentations, you will be asked to defend your choices of data, weights on each indicator (see list below), as well as code quality and methods. You will also be required to tweak your algorithm during the presentation to prove that it can show other cities when the weights/indicators change.
